This diversity caters to a broader audience with varying preferences, which can be a significant factor in retaining and attracting subscribers. It allows Netflix to position itself as a one-stop platform for entertainment, increasing customer satisfaction.\n","\n","Subscriber Retention: By offering a wide range of content, including popular movies and TV shows, Netflix can better retain its existing subscribers. People subscribe to Netflix for different reasons, whether it's to binge-watch a TV series or to catch up on the latest movies. Catering to these preferences can lead to increased subscriber loyalty.\n","\n","Negative Business Impacts:\n","\n","Content Costs: While diversity is a strength, it can also lead to increased content acquisition and licensing costs. Maintaining a vast library of both movies and TV shows requires substantial financial investments. If content acquisition costs rise significantly, it could negatively impact Netflix's profitability.\n","\n","Content Quality: The sheer quantity of content does not guarantee high quality. Netflix must ensure that both movies and TV shows meet quality standards and resonate with its audience. If the balance between quantity and quality is not maintained, it could lead to negative subscriber feedback and churn.\n","\n","Competitive Landscape: The insight that movies dominate the catalog might indicate a competitive landscape where other streaming platforms focus more on TV shows or offer exclusive movie content. This could lead to competition in acquiring popular movies and retaining exclusive rights, potentially increasing costs and competition.\n","\n","In conclusion, the insights about the distribution of content types offer valuable information for Netflix's content strategy. While they highlight the potential positive impact of catering to diverse preferences and retaining subscribers, they also emphasize the challenges of balancing content costs, quality, and competition. Netflix must carefully manage its content portfolio to ensure a positive business impact and address potential negative growth factors."],"metadata":{"id":"3cspy4FjqxJW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Chart - 2"],"metadata":{"id":"KSlN3yHqYklG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Chart - 2 visualization code\n","sns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\n","\n","# Create a histogram of release years\n","plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n","sns.histplot(data=dataset, x='release_year', bins=30, kde=True, color='skyblue')\n","plt.title('Distribution of Content by Release Year on Netflix')\n","plt.xlabel('Release Year')\n","plt.ylabel('Count')\n","\n","# Rotate x-axis labels for better readability\n","plt.xticks(rotation=90)\n","\n","# Show the chart\n","plt.show()"],"metadata":{"id":"R4YgtaqtYklH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##### 1.

This transformation was essential to ensure that these missing values did not interfere with subsequent analyses. We used reasonable defaults, such as \"Unknown\" for categorical columns and \"January 1, 1900\" for date-related columns, to maintain data integrity.\n","\n","Date Handling: We converted the 'date_added' column to a datetime data type and extracted 'month_added' and 'year_added' to create new features. This transformation enabled us to work with date-related information more efficiently, such as exploring trends in content addition over time.\n","\n","Categorical Encoding: We one-hot encoded categorical variables, specifically the 'type' (Movie/TV Show) and 'rating' columns.

Leveraging machine learning techniques and a rich dataset, we navigated through several critical phases to design, develop, and evaluate two distinct machine learning models.\n","\n","ML Model - 1 Implementation:\n","\n","For our first model, we opted for K-Means clustering, a powerful unsupervised learning algorithm. Our objective was to group similar content items together based on their features, such as PCA components. Here's how it unfolded:\n","\n","We started by selecting the relevant features for clustering, which included 'PC1' and 'PC2' derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n","\n","Employed K-Means clustering to create five distinct clusters, enhancing our ability to classify and recommend content.\n","\n","Successfully appended cluster labels to the dataset, enabling us to group similar content items—a crucial step in the recommendation process.\n","\n","ML Model - 1 Hyperparameter Optimization:\n","\n","To further enhance Model 1's performance, we implemented hyperparameter optimization techniques using GridSearchCV. This allowed us to fine-tune the K-Means clustering algorithm, potentially improving cluster quality.\n","\n","ML Model - 2 Implementation:\n","\n","Our second model ventured into supervised learning, specifically employing the Random Forest classifier. This ensemble learning algorithm exhibited remarkable versatility and robustness, making it an ideal choice for our recommendation system.\n","\n","Model 2 achieved exceptional performance, with training accuracy reaching 86% and test accuracy at 82%. This demonstrates its ability to generalize effectively.\n","\n","Precision, a key metric for relevance, was excellent, standing at 89% on the training data and 85% on the test data.\n","\n","Recall scores, which determine the proportion of actual positive content identified correctly, were consistently high at 84% on both training and test data.\n","\n","The F1-Score, a balanced measure of precision and recall, maintained solid values of 0.86 on training data and 0.84 on test data.\n","\n","The ROC-AUC score, highlighting Model 2's discriminative ability, was outstanding at 0.93 on training data and 0.88 on test data.\n","\n","Visualization of Evaluation Metrics:\n","\n","We visualized the evaluation metrics using a bar chart, providing an insightful summary of Model 2's performance. The chart clearly displayed the excellent scores achieved across various metrics.\n","\n","Dimensionality Reduction:\n","\n","In preparation for modeling, we performed dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This process allowed us to visualize the data in two dimensions, facilitating a better understanding of content item relationships.\n","\n","Final Thoughts:\n","\n","In conclusion, our journey to build a content recommendation system was a resounding success. Both Model 1 and Model 2 showcased their capabilities in clustering and classification, respectively. Model 2, in particular, demonstrated exceptional accuracy, precision, recall, and discriminative power.\n","\n","With the power of machine learning and thoughtful data analysis, we have laid the foundation for a robust recommendation system capable of providing users with content tailored to their preferences. This system has the potential to enhance user experience and engagement significantly.\n","\n","As we conclude this project, we look forward to implementing and deploying this recommendation system in real-world scenarios, where it can serve as a valuable tool for content providers and consumers alike."],"metadata":{"id":"Fjb1IsQkh3yE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### ***Hurrah!

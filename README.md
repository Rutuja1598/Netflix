In this data-driven project, we explore the vast catalog of movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset, collected from Flixable, offers a unique opportunity to uncover insights about Netflix's content evolution over the years. With a focus on data analysis and clustering, this project aims to reveal patterns, trends, and groupings within the Netflix content library.
